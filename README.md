> Here is a project I made with Martin Calvinhac during a course project. We made a new file transfer protocol and it's server. It's UDP with some add-ons of TCP and some &#34;personnal&#34;add-ons. We provided two types of servers (and thus protocols) for each type of client.

## Install

```sh
gcc serveur1.c -o serveur1 -lpthread -lrt
```

## Usage
You can also test the serveur2 (+ client2)
```sh
./serveur1 portNo & ./client1 ipAddr portNo fileYouWant
```
